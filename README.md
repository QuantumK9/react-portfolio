# React Portfolio

## Description
This is an attempt to create a portfolio website with React. Unfortunately due to time constraints and really busy final 2 weeks, it is not completed yet. 

Nevertheless, the main structure and routes of the website are completed along with the basic styles and responsiveness. 

Most of the content is still mock content, like information about me and projects displayed. It is meant to be completed shortly in the upcoming days but sadly not within the time frame of the bootcamp. Things that need finishing are: Real content and personal info added, navbar transparency and width adjustment, responsiveness of main page, content of form to be handled with a backend.

Technologies used: React, React Router, React-Hook-Form, Bootstrap 4.
